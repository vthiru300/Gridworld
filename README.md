# Gridworld
Gridworld Implementation
•	Modeled a deep reinforcement learning agent within a grid world environment after the approach described in "Human-Level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning".
•	Created and managed two neural networks using PyTorch: an online network for exploration and a target network for stable Q-value approximation, with periodic synchronization every predetermined number of steps.
•	A demo video was created that showed the trained agent expertly navigating to the interest point, along with two detailed plots that tracked the total reward and steps per episode across training sessions.
